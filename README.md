#############################TODO APP##################################

After building the famous Hello World its time to build a Todo app
to learn more about React Native development, componentization, Props, 
States, and some pretty front endgit config --global user.email "email@example.com"...

I made this Todo App following a youtube tutorial below:

I also made some visual changes and will keep updating adding some new features like a better scroll and AsyncStorage to prevent user loose data.
